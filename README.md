# Low-light-image-enhancement
Low light image enhancement GAN &amp; WGAN implementations using Pix2pix arhitecture

Trained on Google Colab using the [LOL Dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/lol)

### Implementation was helped by the following repositories:

https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix - example used to implement pix2pix

https://github.com/martinarjovsky/WassersteinGAN - used to understand the modifications needed for WGAN
